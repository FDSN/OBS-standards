# OBS-standards

Definintion of marine seismology data and metadata standards, and possibly creation of documents for users

The goals are to:
- define standards (and propose new ones if needed)
- Help data providers to create standardized data and metadata
- Help users to understand and use marine seismology data
- include standards in new “Guidelines for specific datasets” within the StationXML and miniSEED documentation

Current structure is
- one document on standards
- a second document on useful, publically available software tools
- A "References" directory holding old standards documents

The first two documents are initally based on the information in the "References" directory
