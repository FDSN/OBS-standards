# OBS-standards

Definition of marine seismology data and metadata standards, and possibly creation of documents for users

The goals are to:
- define standards (and propose new ones if needed)
- Help data providers to create standardized data and metadata
- Help users to understand and use marine seismology data
- include standards in new “Guidelines for specific datasets” within the StationXML and miniSEED documentation

We want to have a document or documents ready for validation/vote before the next FDSN meeting (September 2025 Lisbon)

The contents of this repository are:
- ``standards.md``: proposed standards
- ``software.md``L useful, publically available software tools
- The 2024 AGU poster about the Action Group
- ``References/``: old standards documents
- ``Meetings/``: notes from Action Group meetings
- ``other/``: miscellaneous files/directories

The first two documents were started from the information in the "References" directory
