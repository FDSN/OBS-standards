## Issues for this meeting

### Minutes of November 2024 meeting ([#41](https://github.com/FDSN/OBS-standards/issues/41))

### Restructure standards.md ([#39](https://github.com/FDSN/OBS-standards/issues/39))
- Had planned to have different name until approbation at this meeting, but changed before AGU for clarity for new visitors.
- Old version is at https://github.com/FDSN/OBS-standards/blob/main/other/_old/standards.md
- No change in content
- Members are invited to comment on new structure

### Ways to indicate time-corrected versus uncorrected in datafiles ([#36](https://github.com/FDSN/OBS-standards/issues/36))

Also issue [#11](https://github.com/FDSN/OBS-standards/issues/11), which is not a sub-issue of #36

- miniSEED2 header fields decided, remaining is for miniSEED3 and SeisComp data structure
    - miniSEED3:
      - [ ] Ask FDSN for an "Uncorrected" boolean in the FDSN Time header?
      - [ ] Ask FDSN for an "effective sampling rate" double in the FDSN Time header?
      - [ ] Ask FDSN for new source code "U_x_", where "_x_" is the instrument code and U specifies Time-Uncorrected?
    - Seiscomp Data Structure
      - [ ] Ask GEMPA to create new "time-uncorrected waveform data" TYPE character (U)?

### OBS elements missing in StationXML ([#31](https://github.com/FDSN/OBS-standards/issues/31))

Also issue [#1: Add OBS-specific parameters using external namespace?](https://github.com/FDSN/OBS-standards/issues/1),
which is now a sub-issue

- [ ] Add general rule to ``standards.md``?
      1) Define needed elements
      2) Put into StationXML as JSON-formatted comments
      3) Consult with FDSN WGII for StationXML addition

*if/when read->write problem resolved, replace 2) with "Put into OBS namespace element"*

### Information about leveling systems in StationXML file [#28](https://github.com/FDSN/OBS-standards/issues/28)

- Sent proposed element and structure to WG2 chairs
- P Crotwell responded, recommending that Leveler be an instance of Equipment, possibly with added fields
- [ ] Request FDSN to create ``Leveler`` element at Channel level (affects response), using EquipmentType with
      additional ``<Threshold>`` and ``<Accuracy>`` sub-elements and ``units`` attribute?
- Until then, use:
      - [ ] Additional standard Channel-> Equipment field, or
      - [ ] marine-specific element (Comment for now, namespace in future?) within Channel

### How to specify ``start_date`` and ``end_date`` (and cut data)
- Updates from anyone?
- [ ] Upgrade to "thorny"?

### Contact companies about implementing msmod drift corrections ([#24](https://github.com/FDSN/OBS-standards/issues/24))
- [ ] Close?

### Station names for repeated deployments ([#18](https://github.com/FDSN/OBS-standards/issues/18))

Upgrade document with:
- [ ] "significant travel-time residual discrepancy" criteria?
- [ ] Information (and link) about RCM elements?

### How to specify leap seconds in metadata ([#17](https://github.com/FDSN/OBS-standards/issues/17))

- Accept proposed format?

### items needing responses from group members:
- #### How to handle leap seconds [#32]
- #### Specify how to convert geophone "N" and "E" channels to "1" and "2" [#10](https://github.com/FDSN/OBS-standards/issues/10)

## Issues to close
