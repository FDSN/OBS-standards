# OBS standards Action Group meeting 2024-05-14

Present: John Collins, Yinshuang Ai, Jerry Carter, Susanne Hemmleb, Kasey Aderhold, Wayne Crawford

## Notable decisions


## Discussion

### Nomenclature of standards versus guidelines

> **SHemmleb**: At our group meeting, Angelo didn't like the word "standards", would prefer "guidelines", which he considers stronger.
>
> **Wayne**: I think "standards" is stronger than "guidelines", will look it up

*SHemmleb started an issue that goes a little beyond the above question and into the question of
"recommendations" and "best practices"*

### Requirement of CORRECTED data for data centers

> **CCorela**: A recent experiment had drifts from 1-20 seconds, with multi-second non-linearities after linear drift correction.  Should OBS facilities be required to supply corrected data?
>
> **WCrawford**: The current `standards` document does not specify requiring corrected data, it
> just lists the three possible types of "time correction": RAW, CORRECTED and xxxx and discusses
> how to specify them.  That said, it is much more efficient and reproduceable for a provider to correct
> the data before sending it to the data center than for each user to have to try to do it him/herself.
>
> **JCollins**: Should supply CORRECTED data
>
> **Wayne**: Suggest that CORRECTED be highly recommended (one level below "standard"?)
>
> **Wayne**: This should become easier for facilities to apply once `msmod` has been updated to create
> piecewise-linear clock correction.
>
> **JCollins**; Would really like this, as our OBSs will recalibrate at fixed intervals during a deployment (by waking a CSAC).
>
> **WCrawford**: I've been dragging my feet on writing to the software company that should do this work, for fear
> that my specification is inadequate.  **Will send this specification to the Action Group list + Chad Trabant
> to validate before sending to the company**
>

### Specification of CORRECTED versus uncorrected data

> **WCrawford**: The current recommendation is to specify a data quality code of "D" for UNCORRECTED data and "Q" for corrected data.
> This will need to be updated for miniSEED3, and there are some that would prefer to use the
> location code for this (see issue XX)


**Decision**: present at AGU 2024, EGU 2025; send june/december update mails to FDSN community.  At conferences: poster with opportunity for conversation.  Also regional conferences as members wish (inform the group please).

> **JCarter**: Thu and Fri before EGU, has a meeting with ORFEUS to talk about FDSN standards, could be a good place to bring this work up.

## Next meeting

First half of July 2024. Wayne should **send out a Doodle immediately**

Every two months seems reasonable to the members.
