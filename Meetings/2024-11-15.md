## Issues for this meeting

### Document changes since September 2024 meeting [#40](https://github.com/FDSN/OBS-standards/issues/40)

### Restructure standards.md [#39](https://github.com/FDSN/OBS-standards/issues/39)


### Drift correction document [#37](https://github.com/FDSN/OBS-standards/issues/37)

Remaining is mostly about the order of columns

### Add leap-second correction line to msmod? [#33](https://github.com/FDSN/OBS-standards/issues/33)

John approved, Wayne wrote proposal doc
- John suggests have the option to either provide seconds or leapseconds string

### Information about leveling systems in StationXML file [#28](https://github.com/FDSN/OBS-standards/issues/28)

ToDo for Wayne?

### Find reference documentation for keeping the same station name for multiple deployments [#21](https://github.com/FDSN/OBS-standards/issues/21)

### Add OBS-specific parameters using external namespace? [#1](https://github.com/FDSN/OBS-standards/issues/1)

Our first issue!

## Issues lacking discussion

Numbers 10, 25, 31, 32 and 36

### Include data quality in SDS's data_type character [#36]

### How to handle leap seconds [#32]

Wayne should see what has been answered by the recent changes, but there are some logical conundrums that require reflection

### OBS elements missing in StationXML [#31]

### How to specify start_dates and end_dates (and cut data) [#25]

### Specify how to convert geophone "N" and "E" channels to "1" and "2" [#10]

## Issues to close

### Should we include miniSEED 3 information? [#35]

Responders say yes

### Find a clock drift calculation code using noise [#34]

Add codes on ORFEUS poster and close

### Modifications to September 2024 minutes

No modifications proposed

### Validate description of msmod modifications[#27]

Wayne sent request to ISTI website, no response yet (is there a good email address?).  Wayne think's all that's unresolved is the column order (issue #37)

### Recommendations or best practices instead of standards?

I think we resolved this?

## Issues to open

### Modifications to November 2024 minutes



## Other topics


## Date/hour for next meeting

Early-mid January?

- [ ] Send out Doodle quickly [Wayne]
- [ ] Send out calendar notification once date chosen [Kasey]

## Other To Dos

- [ ] Wayne write to Chad Trabant about adding an Extra Header Field concerning clock correction, and whether this field could be selectable in ```fdsnws_dataselect```, plus whether/how "data publication version" will be selectable in ```fdsnws_dataselect``` (Issue 11)
    - Is there a better way to contact Chad, or a colleague that is less thin-spread?

- [ ] Wayne write to Chad Trabant (or other?) to see if leveling system information (issue #28) could/should be added to next version of StationXML.
