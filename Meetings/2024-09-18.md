## Issues

### changes to clock correction (#29)
Accept combining "type" and "interpolation"
Reject adding possibility for "offset" in seconds

### cubic spline and polynomials (#26)
Polynomial format is outlined in issue #15
**Put it back in**! with "bdyer beware" warning and error-checking of bounds.



## Other topics

## leap second ##
in what order do we correct leap seconds and clock drift?  And do we note clock synchronization accounted for leap seconds or not?
**NEED TO HAVE AN OFFLINE DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS BEFORE NEXT MEETING**
**RECOMMEND ORDER OF CORRECTION: LEAP SECOND FIRST, OR DRIFT?**

## Date/hour for next meeting

Early-mid November?
After 3 November, all changed to winter hours, so:

- if we do not change the GMT hour, will be worse for US Pacific (6-8 AM)
- if we advance the GMT hour by one, will be worse for Japan and China (23-01h) and Japan (00-02h)

Recommend keeping GMT hour

- [ ] Send out Doodle quickly [Wayne]
- [ ] Send out calendar notification once date chosen [Kasey]

## Other To Dos

- [ ] Contact ISTI about implementing msmod drift correction [Wayne]
- [ ] Send AGU presentation before next meeting [Wayne]
