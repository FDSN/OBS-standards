## Date/hour for next meeting

Early-mid November?
After 3 November, all changed to winter hours, so:

- if we do not change the GMT hour, will be worse for US Pacific (6-8 AM)
- if we advance the GMT hour by one, will be worse for Japan and China (23-01h) and Japan (00-02h)

Recommend keeping GMT hour

- [ ] Send out Doodle quickly [Wayne]
- [ ] Send out calendar notification once date chosen [Kasey]

## Other To Dos

- [ ] Contact ISTI about implementing msmod drift correction [Wayne]
- [ ] Send AGU presentation before next meeting [Wayne]
