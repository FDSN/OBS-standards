# OBS-specific Software
There are several publically available software modules that can be useful for confirming or correcting data and metadata. If you calculate better clock drift or sensor
orientation values than those provided in the data center,  inform the data center of the new values and the method you used to calculate them.
It would be best if all of these codes worked on the same data/metadata formats (for example, SeisComp Data Structure and StationXML)

## Descriptions

### Modifying miniseed files
Few (none?) of these tools are OBS-specific, but they can be used for OBS-specific tasks

### Creating metadata

[obsinfo](https://obsinfo.readthedocs.io) is a tool for creating StationXML files that include OBS-specific information

### Clock drift confirmation
The instrument clock drift (relative to a reference instrument) can be calculated using noise correlation (REF_SITE) or using the observed drift in hypocenter traveltime residuals.

### Sensor orientation calculation/correction
Determining the horizontal orientation of the instrument using teleseisms, local earthquakes and/or active seismic sources. A common method used is the Rayleigh wave polarization method, outlined in the Stachnik et al., 2012 paper[^1]
with code made available on the OBSIP website.

### Noise removal
Removal of noise caused by infragravity waves (based on pressure measurements) and dynamic tilt (based on correlation with horizontal channel noise).


### Active seismic data extractor
A program to input continuous data-center-level data and a shot file (in some standardized format) and output SEG-Y files.
